This is a POC for an agent editor inside the Vercel AI chatbot.

The idea is to have a simple interface that allows me to design agents:

- I can add a list of [tools](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers?tab=readme-ov-file)
- Set other settings like, based on the ai sdk api spec (e.g: maxSteps)
- Set system prompt for the agent.
- Agent workflows (connecting agents with each other)
